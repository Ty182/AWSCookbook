### AWS Cookbook 

- The hands-on AWS exercises found here in this repository are from the book, [AWS Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/AWS-Cookbook-Recipes-Success/dp/1492092606/). 

- The author's repository is publically available and hosted [here](https://github.com/AWSCookbook)

- These miny projects are for fun and to get more hands-on experience with AWS. 

- Since the authors only make a [few receipes](https://github.com/AWSCookbook/Getting-Started/blob/main/ListOfFreeRecipes.md) available for free, I'll only host walkthroughs for these here on this public GitHub repo.

#### List of free receipes as of May 2022
